# Hub-and-Spoke-versus-Rotational-Port-Networks
This repository contains the simulation and analysis code associated with my undergraduate thesis, completed in 2025. The project focuses on modeling and comparing hub-and-spoke and rotational routing schemes for maritime cargo shipping. I plan to continue this research, and updates will be posted intermittently.
